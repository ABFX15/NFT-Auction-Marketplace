# High Issues

## H-1: Uninitialized State Variables

Solidity does initialize variables by default when you declare them, however it's good practice to explicitly declare an initial value. For example, if you transfer money to an address we must make sure that the address has been initialized.

- Found in src/SellerNft.sol [Line: 11](src/SellerNft.sol#L11)

	```solidity
	    uint256 private tokenCounter;
	```

</details>



## H-2: Sending native Eth is not protected from these functions.

Introduce checks for `msg.sender` in the function

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/AuctionContract.sol [Line: 198](src/AuctionContract.sol#L198)

	```solidity
	    function withdraw() public {
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>3 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/AuctionContract.sol [Line: 12](src/AuctionContract.sol#L12)

	```solidity
	contract AuctionContract is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, IERC721Receiver {
	```

- Found in src/SellerNft.sol [Line: 10](src/SellerNft.sol#L10)

	```solidity
	contract SellerNFT is ERC721, Ownable {
	```

- Found in src/SellerNft.sol [Line: 22](src/SellerNft.sol#L22)

	```solidity
	    function approveToAuction(address auctionContract, uint256 tokenId) external onlyOwner{
	```

</details>



## L-2: Unsafe ERC20 Operations should not be used

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

	```solidity
	        nft.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), tokenId);
	```

	```solidity
	        payable(auction.seller).transfer(sellerEth);
	```

</details>



## L-3: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

	```solidity
	    function onERC721Received(
	```

## L-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```

</details>



## L-5: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.
